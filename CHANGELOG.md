## Unreleased

### Added

- Initial repository structure.
- Project mission, goals, non-goals, and development principles.
- Architecture and implementation-planning documents.
- AI-agent development rules.
- Contribution guidance.
- Development journal and roadmap.
- Pinned local NVDA source-reference metadata.
- Phase 1B Piper runtime evaluation and proposed process-isolated runtime ADR.
- Source-backed review of Sonata, Hear2Read NG, and built-in NVDA synthesizer patterns.
- Add-on Store readiness, native dependency, security, accessibility, licensing, and release checklists.
- Phase 1C detailed lifecycle, job, worker protocol, audio, model, configuration, error-recovery, and threat-model designs.
- Testing, CI, accessibility acceptance, governance, support, documentation, source-register, repository-quality, and exact Phase 2 implementation plans.
- AddonTemplate-aligned metadata-only package generation, localizable manifest text, packaged English help, and focused archive validation.
- A minimal `nvdaPiperDriver` synthesizer module that remains deliberately unavailable because `check()` returns `False`.
- An exact, process-local, test-only availability gate for isolated discovery, construction, and termination validation.

The driver remains unavailable in normal use and produces no speech when the development gate is enabled. No Piper runtime, worker, audio implementation, runtime binary, or voice model has been added. The package is not a public release and has not been submitted to the Add-on Store.
